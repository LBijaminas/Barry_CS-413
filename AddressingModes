Addressing mode: way in which we access data

-effective address: the address of the data we want

-REGISTERS NOT DISTURBED-

register mode: the register holds the data
-the data is already available in the cpu's register
-eax = data we want
-no bus activity

register direct mode: the register holds the address
-the data must be fetched into the processor from the memory location
-ebx = 1000, ds:1000 = data we want
-bus activity required for retrieving data, just once 

indirect/deferred mode: register holds an address with the address we want
-ebx = 1000, ds:1000 = 1010, ds:1010 = data we want
-bus activity required for retrieving data, twice

index mode: number added to register contents to give effective address
-ebx = 1000, index = 4, ebx + 4 = ds:1004 = data we want
-register holding initial address referred to as base register

index inderect mode: effective address calculated isn't data, just address
-ebx = 1000, index = 4, ebx + 4 = ds:1004 = 1010, ds:1010 = data we want

-REGISTERS DISTURBED-

auto-increment mode: register holds address, after use increment reg

auto-increment deferred mode: auto-increment mode with indirect addressing

auto-decrement mode: register holds address, after use decrement reg

auto-decrement deferred mode: auto-decrement mode with indirect addressing
